                Title:  Armando stuck in time at the year 2022
		Semester/Year:  Spring 2021
		Software: Photoshop and  After Effects.

		In my final project, my inspiration was time traveling through time because I do like watching movies of Avengers Endgame, Terminator Genisys, and Terminator Dark Fate. It was easy  to draw what my character would like but it was difficult to plan my character’s story. I chose to make my final project into an animated short. My video is about my character named Armando who walks out of a store and wants to go home. As Armando continues walking outside from the subway, he sees a time portal stranded outside of a building. He got closer to it and sucked his whole body through the time portal. When the portal opened, he got out and realized he’s in the past in the year 2022.  I used photoshop to create my animated short and borrow photos from creative commons. I tried to use the timeline instead of frame animation because I would use onion skins to draw my character’s action with the brush and color tool.  When I was brainstorming from my storyboard, it did help to picture how many photos I will use and what action will my character move as I start playing in my timeline.  It does look great how it turned out in my timeline but I used 4fps because there wasn’t any way to slow down my video.</p>
